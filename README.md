Data Structures Project
This project, titled "Data Structures," provides an interactive and educational overview of common data structures. It's a static HTML page that visually represents and explains the purpose, use cases, and time complexity of several fundamental data structures. The project is created by Desire Vargas for CSE 212, a Data Structures course.

üßê Purpose
The goal of this project is to serve as a simple, yet effective reference guide for students learning about data structures. It uses clear visuals and concise explanations to compare and contrast different data structures, making complex concepts easier to grasp. It's an excellent tool for quick study sessions or for refreshing your knowledge on the topic.

üì¶ Data Structures Covered
The project includes an interactive table that details the following data structures:

Dynamic Array: A resizable array that provides efficient random access.

Linked List: A linear data structure where elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations, making insertions and deletions highly efficient.

Stack: A LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) data structure used for managing data in a specific order.

Queue: A FIFO (First-In, First-Out) data structure, ideal for handling sequential tasks.

Map (Hash-based): A collection of key-value pairs that offers near-instantaneous access and retrieval.

Balanced Binary Search Tree (BST): A tree-based data structure that maintains balance to ensure efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations with a logarithmic time complexity.

Each entry in the table includes a visual representation, a brief explanation of its purpose with a real-world example, and the time complexity for its primary operations.

üöÄ How to Use
Since this project is a single, static HTML file, you don't need any special tools or servers to run it.

Clone the repository: If you're using Git, you can clone this repository to your local machine.

Open the file: Simply open the index.html file in any web browser.

The page will load, displaying the interactive table and all its contents.

üõ† Technologies Used
HTML: The core markup language for structuring the page content.

CSS: Used for styling the page and creating the visual graphics for each data structure, ensuring a clean and intuitive user interface.
